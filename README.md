# HourTracker
Allowing users to clock in and clock out (for work), and track their total number of hours worked.

~ 5/14/18 2:30pm

    Users are able to clock in, clock out, and view their own times.

    Supervisors are able to work as users and access/change hours of other users.

    Code is being tested in basic cpp; once finished, a code like this would potentially be made on Qt to make it user friendly.

    Uknown bug occured using visual studios; it is fixed, no need to abort.
    
    Created a vector of employees for the supervisor. 
    
    Need to add: Log in (vector search for employee number), clock in and clock out test.
